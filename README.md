# Forest Fires
<p>This is a common regression machine learning problem.</p>

### Why?
<p>Forest fires, or wildfires, are fast-spreading, uncontrolled fires in forests and wild areas.</p>
<p>They're often caused by dry weather, lightning, human activities, or arson.</p>
<p>These fires threaten the environment, wildlife, and communities. Preventing, detecting, and suppressing wildfires are key strategies used by scientists and firefighters.</p>
<p>Recent technological advances, like artificial intelligence, are helping improve early detection and response efforts, aiding in better management of these destructive events.</p>

### What I did?
<p>In the beginning, I evaluated some regression models.</p>
<p>The model with the best score is used to predict the size of the devastated area.</p>
